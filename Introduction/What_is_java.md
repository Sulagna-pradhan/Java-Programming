## 🔑 Key Characteristics

- **Platform Independent:**  
  Write once, run anywhere! Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on any system with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

- **Object-Oriented:**  
  Java follows the object-oriented paradigm, making it easier to organize code using classes and objects.

- **Robust & Secure:**  
  Java has strong memory management and built-in security features, making it reliable for large-scale applications.

- **Multithreaded:**  
  Java allows multiple threads to run concurrently, which is useful for modern applications like games and servers.

- **Simple & Familiar:**  
  Java syntax is easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++.
